# Preferred Gamerules

A lightweight mod for customizing the default values of gamerules. In particular, the default values that are applied when creating a new world.

Preferences are saved in `.minecraft/config/preferred-gamerules.properties`.
Each gamerule name is prefixed with `gamerule.*`.

Preferences can also be edited in-game via **ModMenu**, if installed. In this case, only values that are different from vanilla's default values will be tracked.
